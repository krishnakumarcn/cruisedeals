Dreaming of cruising in 2017? Then this offer could be right up your street. Sail away onboard Thomson Cruises’ fantastic ship Thomson Dream to discover the beautiful shores of Jamaica and Mexico.

You’ll fly straight from London Gatwick to Montego Bay to join your super ship for 14 nights of fun in the sun. Not sailed with Thomson before? Oh boy, are you in for a treat! This spacious ship offers a great choice of facilities for the whole family – enjoy spectacular sea views around the main pool, treat yourself at the parade of shops, or head to the Pure Portrait Studio for a professional photoshoot! There’s also an array of bars and lounges where you can stop off for drinks if you’re in the mood.

You’ll love the cuisine onboard too – with six restaurants to choose from, there’s something to suit most tastes. You can even grab afternoon tea every day if you so wish, and don’t forget to dress to impress at the captain’s weekly dinner. The menu is amazing!

As the stars come out, so does the star entertainment. The West End-style musicals are something else – with costume changes that will dazzle and amaze you. Feeling lucky? Head to the casino and enjoy a flutter on the roulette or blackjack tables. After your busy sea days, you’ll be welcomed by the comfort of your plushly designed cabin.
